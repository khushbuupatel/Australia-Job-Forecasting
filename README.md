# Australia Job Forecasting

The following jupyter notebook aims to forecast the Australian job pre-covid pandemic and post-covid pandemic. The [dataset](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6202.0Jan%202020?OpenDocument) is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

The first image shows the Australian job forecast if the covid-19 pandemic had not occurred. And the second image shows the job forecast after the covid-19 pandemic. It is evident from the images that the job sector has been affected because of the pandemic. 
However, it shows that it will gradually increase.
